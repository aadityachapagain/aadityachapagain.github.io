Hello! I'm Aaditya Chapagain. About myself, I love Esports (especially dota 2), traveling and reading. I have a great interest in Artificial Intelligence and am pursuing my career in the same. 

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://www.fusemachines.com) working with global client teams to build state-of-the-art products. I have worked in the domains of Recommendation System, speech recognition, Natural Language processing system during my time at Fusemachines.

My problem solving nature, craving for knowledge, and longing for novelty and innovation strengthen my passion to work and learn daily to increase my knowledge horizon.

I am mostly into tech amd biology. So, my blog will be a reflection of whatever new thing I learn about tech and Human Biology.

Thank you for visiting my blog.
